## PS-900

PS-900 Drum machine is a quick project did in my spare-time for exercise with DOM manipulation. 

### How to: 

* **Pad:**  you can press each of the keys to reproduce the sound linked to that specific 'pad'. 

* **Sequencer:** Is also possible to program the sequencer, click with the mouse on a pad and the selected sound will be stored in one of the sequencer steps. When the whole 8 steps are filled click play or press enter. Enjoy the groove!

#### Possible upgrades:

* selecting different samples for each pad.

* tempo controller. 

* augmenting/diminishing the number of bars

* Modify single steps

#### Technologies:
* Html
* Css
* Javascript
